Hello! 

My name is KuroRyder and this is a script I created to play rock, paper, scissors!

Special thanks to my friend, Sev, who guided me through this and has been an absolute blessing in helping me learn Python.

In order to use this script you'll need to download and install python 3, which is super easy!

Download Link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you download and install Python 3, you can save the rockpaperscissorsproject.py script to a folder or your desktop, then 
you will have: 

A program that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors with you!

Enter your choice: Rock, Paper or Scissors
The computer will then randomly choose
The program will compare your answers and spit out a winner.
You can also keep track of the win count while you play.

All feedback is welcome!! Feel free to email me suggestions at KuroRyderrr@gmail.com and any errors you come across. 


In time I will be working on making this a fully functioning webpage for easier access.

Thank you for your feedback and support!

-Kuro
